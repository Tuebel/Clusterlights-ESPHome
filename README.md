# Clusterlights-ESPHome
(Hacky) implementation for clusterlights (BLE Christmas lights) in ESPHome for home assistant.
This will enable a button for "On/Off", one for full / half "Brightness", and a menu to select effects.

Add your secrets to `your_secrets.yaml` and rename it to `secrets.yaml` to avoid pushing the secrets to public repositories. Or add it to the secrets directly in the ESPHome compiler web UI.
